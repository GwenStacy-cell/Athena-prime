## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Active Anti-Nuke Self-Healing Shield
- **Unauthorized Mutations Blocked**: Real-time monitoring of channel deletions, role deletions, channel creations, role creations, vanity URL changes, and role permission grants.
- **Dynamic Restorations & Rollbacks**:
  - **Deleted Channel Recovery**: Re-creates deleted channels instantly with identical name, type, parent category, position, topic, and permission overwrites!
  - **Deleted Role Recovery**: Re-creates deleted roles instantly with original colors, hoist state, permissions, and position!
  - **Vanity URL Recovery**: Instantly restores custom server vanity URLs to their original codes.
  - **Role Grant Rollback**: Instantly removes unauthorized role assignments, and **strips all roles** from the administrator who granted them.
  - **Creation Rollback**: Instantly deletes unauthorized channels/roles.
- **Server Owner DM Complaints**: Sends a direct complaint message to the **Server Owner** (`guild.ownerId`) detailing the violator's ID, the violation type, the enforced punishment (Ban/Kick/Quarantine), and the rollback success status.
- **Immediate Ban Enforcements**: By default, server destruction actions result in an **immediate ban** (configurable via the Buttons Panel).

### 🎙️ Stateful Voice Channel Isolation
- **Active Dragging**: When a user is quarantined, if they are currently connected to voice, the bot caches their `voiceChannelId` and drags/moves them into the designated **Quarantine VC**.
- **VC Position Restoration**: Once unquarantined, if the user is connected, the bot automatically moves them back to their previous voice channel.
- **Visual VC Setup**: Easily bind your server's Quarantine VC using `!setup quarantinevc <Voice_Channel_Name>`.

### 🎛️ Interactive Button-Based Console
- **`!antinuke config`**: Opens a beautiful, interactive embed panel. Administrators can click visual button switches to toggle active protections dynamically and cycle Anti-Nuke punishments between `BAN`, `KICK`, and `QUARANTINE`.
- **`!antinuke enable all` / `disable all`**: Flips all security systems instantly.

### ⚡ Smart AutoMod Filters
- **Prefix-less Ping**: Simply typing `ping` (case-insensitive, no prefix) returns a bold Latency and API speed report (e.g. "**45ms**" / "**52ms**").
- **Profanity Swear Filter**: Automatically deletes messages matching your custom blacklist phrases. Issues warnings and quarantines users exceeding limits.
- **Active Channel Alerts**: All warnings, spam purges, and AutoMod restrictions are posted directly in the channel/VC text chat where the violation occurred.

## 📁 Technical Architecture
The bot saves data locally in `data/db.json`. Here is how database files are structured:
- `guilds`: Saves customized text channel logging targets, prefixes, autonick rules, word blacklists, whitelists, and toggles.
- `warnings`: Stores warning reasons, warner IDs, and timestamps.
- `quarantines`: Caches isolated users' original roles and voice channels.

*All system configurations are self-healing. If `#security-logs` or the `#quarantine-zone` channels are missing, the bot creates them automatically when needed!*
